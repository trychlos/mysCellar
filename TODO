                from the Jeedom controller
     2017- 5- 2 done

   2 2017- 5-10 after a flood, the module sends many on-off messages
                (probably while it is drying) - and then stays blocked
                on 'on' state
     2017- 5-12 fixed

   3 2019- 5-16 review messages so that all actions/configurations are on child 0
				all status come from one child per capteur with different messages
     2019- 5-20 for 7.1-2019 version:
                - child MAIN is nÂ° 1 : only manages global, node-level, actions
                  this is an action-only node, which does not present any information
                  by itself, and thus, is not presented to the controller
                - infos children are numbered 20, 30..
