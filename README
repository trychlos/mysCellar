 Description
 ===========

 The mysCellar sensor is an Arduino Nano-based MySensors v 2.1x sensor.

 It sends to the controller:
 - the current temperature
 - the current humidity rate
 - the current flood sensor analog value
 - an alert when the door is opened or closed
 - an alert when the cellar is flooded.

 Current temperature, humidity rate and flood sensor analog values, later
 said "measures" are only sent when changed, but not more than the
 configurable 'max_frequency'.

 Flood and door alarms, later said "alarms" are sent as soon as they are
 detected.

 If they do not change, measure and alarm status are periodically re-sent
 on a configurable 'unchanged' timeout.

 CAV-01 - Flooding detection
 ===========================

  Composants:
  - Foliar rain sensor module sensitive sensor module (AliExpress USD 0.91)
  - Arduino Nano (AliExpress EUR 2.91 x 5)

    [1] The rain sensor detects water that completes the circuits on
        its sensor boards' printed leads. The sensor board acts as a
        variable resistor that will change from 100k ohms when wet to
        2M ohms when dry. In short, the wetter the board the more
        current that will be conducted.
    [2] Connect the 5V power supply , power indicator light , sensor 
        board does not drop when , DO output is high , the switch lights
        off , dripping a drop of water , DO output is low , the switch
        indicator light,

  Though the detection is quasi-immediate, returning to the normal state
  leads to many bounces. In order to prevent these bounces to trigger
  false alerts, the sensor is automatically unarmed after an alarm has
  been triggered.
  The sensors then auto-rearms itself after a configurable 'auto_rearm'
  delay.

  The flood sensor has two indicator lights:
  - whether the sensor is armed (added in v 6.0.2017),
  - whether an alarm has been trigerred (added in v 6.0.2017);
    this later light stays On until the alarm is rearmed.

    Nano output:
    - VCC 5v to sensor
    - GND

    Nano input
    - logical D0 (from HIGH=dry to LOW=wet) -> D4 [D4]
    - analog A0 (from 1023=dry to 0=soak)   -> ADC7 (analog only) [A7]
    - logical D5 (output) : whether the alarm has been tripped
    - logical D6 (output) : whether the alarm is armed

 CAV-04 - Door opening
 =====================

 The sensor is provided by the Telemecanique door switch.
 This is a double-relais platine, with a NO and a NC contacts.
 The NC contact is used by origin for lights.
 We are using here the NO contact for the door opening detector:
 - door closed : contact is closed
 - door opened: contact is opened.

 A 10k resistor is connected to get the opening detection.

 The opening sensor has one indicator light:
 - whether the door is opened (A1).
